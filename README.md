# The AVL Tree: An Ever Efficient Binary Search Tree
Betsy Bailey and Erica Naglik
### Our implementation of the AVL Tree: a self balancing binary search tree.

## How to:
To see this AVL tree in action yourself clone into this repository and run `python3 avl_tree.py`

The AVL Tree enforces one major concept: that there can be no major difference between the heights of a tree’s left and right subtrees. If there is more than a slight difference in the height of two subtrees, the AVL Tree will perform a rotation to restore balance to the tree, and maintain the binary search tree’s efficiency we all know and love.
